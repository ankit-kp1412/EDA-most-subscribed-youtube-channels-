# EDA-most-subscribed-youtube-channels

To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) á¸¥on a provided dataset using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Statistics, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. You will answer questions and complete tasks related to understanding, cleaning, exploring, and visualising the data.

**Import Libraries:** Begin by importing the necessary libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Statistics, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.
**Data Source**- https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14aBHkVwZ0FW62CXaDECzCRQUramxkLD6wBz2DmvnHXI/edit?usp=sharing

**Data Cleaning:**

>Check for missing values and handle them appropriately (e.g., dropping rows/columns, imputation).

>Explore the data types of each column and ensure they are correct.

>Identify and handle any outliers or anomalies.

**Data Understanding:**

>Describe the dataset: number of rows and columns, data types, etc.

>Summarise the central tendency and dispersion of numerical features (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation).

>Explore the distribution of categorical features.

**Data Exploration and Visualization:**

>Create histograms to visualise the distribution of numerical features.

>Visualise the distribution of categorical features (e.g., 'Category' and 'City') using bar charts or pie charts to understand the frequency of each category.

>Use boxplots to compare distributions across different groups or categories.

>Explore relationships between variables using scatter plots or correlation matrices.

>Generate bar charts or pie charts to visualise categorical data.

>Employ Seaborn to create more advanced visualisations like pairplots, heatmaps, etc.


**Analysed:**
>Is there a clear relationship between a channel's rank and its number of subscribers? Explore this using scatter plots and correlation analysis.

>Analyse the distribution of subscribers across different category groups. Are there certain categories where channels tend to have significantly more subscribers?

>Explore the relationship between a channel's started year and its subscriber growth rate. Do newer channels tend to grow faster than older channels?

>Identify the top 3 ranked channels within each category. Are there any channels that consistently rank high across multiple categories?

>If data from multiple time periods is available, analyse how the rank of channels has changed over time.

>Explore the relationship between the video count and the number of subscribers for each channel. Do channels with more uploaded videos tend to have more subscribers?

>Compare the average video views for different category groups. Are there certain content categories that generally attract more views?

>Analyse the relationship between the average number of video views and the frequency of video uploads for each channel.

>Explore how the distribution of category types within the top 100 channels has changed over time (if data from multiple periods is available). Are there any emerging content categories gaining popularity?

>Identify the top 10 videos with the highest video views within each category. Analyse any commonalities or patterns among these high-performing videos.

>Is there a correlation between the number of subscribers a channel has and the average number of video views it receives?

>Analyse the number of different category types each channel creates content for. Do successful channels tend to specialise in one category or diversify their content?

>Explore if there are any noticeable differences in the category choices or video count for channels that started in different time periods.

>Analyse whether the frequency of video uploads varies across different category groups.

>Compare the performance metrics (subscriber count, video views) of channels that started early (e.g., before 2010) to those that started more recently.

>Analyse the relationship between a channel's rank and its average number of video views. Do higher-ranked channels consistently get more views?

>Explore the relationship between a channel's rank and its video count. Do higher-ranked channels tend to have a larger number of uploaded videos?

>Analyse whether certain category types are associated with faster or slower subscriber growth rates.

>Explore if there's a relationship between a channel's age (started year) and its average engagement metrics (e.g., likes/dislikes ratio, comments per view).

>Analyse whether channels that consistently focus on a specific category tend to have different growth patterns compared to channels with more diverse content.
